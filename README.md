# Notebooks
Notebooks released by the JWST ERS TEMPLATES team, to download, reduce, and analyze JWST data.

Let's break down how to get started on JWST data into simple steps.  We'll use the ERS TEMPLATES program as an example, because hey, that's our program.  Feel free to grab these tools and use them for your own purposes.  

Step 0) You probably should install the JWST pipeline.  [Thie simple notebook 0_install_pipeline.ipynb](https://github.com/JWST-Templates/Notebooks/blob/main/0_install_pipeline.ipynb) shows you how.

Step 1) Get some sweet sweet JWST data.  You can do this from the MAST portal, but many find it hard to use, so we recommend a simple command-line script.

Step 2) (Coming soon) Run the pipeline on the raw data to apply the latest reference files.
