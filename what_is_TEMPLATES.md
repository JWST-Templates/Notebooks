This is the public github repository made by the JWST team "TEMPLATES: Targeting Extremely Magnified Panchromatic Lensed Arcs and their Extended Star formation".

TEMPLATES is an approved 55-hour JWST observing program to study star formation in four gravitationally lensed galaxies at redshifts of 1 to 4.

TEMPLATES is one of 13 approved [Early Release Science](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/approved-ers-programs) programs, using Director's Discretionary Time.  

The [TEMPLATES website](https://sites.google.com/view/jwst-templates/) explains our program's science goals and observing strategy.

TEMPLATES uses 4 observing modes of JWST:  MIRI imaging, MIRI MRS spectroscopy, NIRCam imaging, and NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy.

ERS programs are supposed 

Write up some twitterable content about what’s in the Notebook/ (Gourav, Jane)
GK’s thoughts: 
Describe the motivation behind releasing the github repository (ERS program, guidepost to reductions, data checks, analysis methodologies, etc.)
What is the simplest way to download the data, and reduce it?
Describe the data modes - NIRCam, NIRSpec, MIRI observations very broadly – refer to website!
Summarise Step 0, 1 and 2 (as mentioned in the README)
Different types of files?
Arguments that go into pulling the data- PID and such
