This is the public github repository of the JWST team "TEMPLATES: Targeting Extremely Magnified Panchromatic Lensed Arcs and their Extended Star formation".

TEMPLATES is an approved 55-hour JWST observing program to study star formation in four gravitationally lensed galaxies at redshifts of 1 to 4.

TEMPLATES is one of 13 approved [Early Release Science](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/approved-ers-programs) programs, using Director's Discretionary Time.  

The [TEMPLATES website](https://sites.google.com/view/jwst-templates/) explains our program's science goals and observing strategy.

TEMPLATES uses 4 observing modes of JWST:  MIRI imaging, MIRI MRS spectroscopy, NIRCam imaging, and NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy.

ERS programs have multiple additional goals beyond science goals.  Templates has [four science goals and five technical goals](https://sites.google.com/view/jwst-templates/).  Most of our technical goals boil down to establishing best practices for calibrating and reducing the data, and sharing that knowledge via Notebooks.  

Which is why this github repo exists!  Here, we're sharing our methodologies as we develop them.

One of our goals was to get users up to speed as quickly as possible.  There's a lot of documentation out there already, and it can get pretty overwhelming.  So,let's keep it simple: What's the simplest way to download JWST data, reduce it, and start analyzing?
